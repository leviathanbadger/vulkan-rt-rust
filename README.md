# vulkan-rt-rust

Another attempt at a "game"/"graphics" engine written in Rust + Vulkan, this time with
more of a focus on 1. modular graphics and platform adapters, and 2. ray-tracing first,
rasterization second render pipelines.

As always, this is not meant to be a serious production-ready engine. It's an excuse to
push myself and learn new things. It will be inefficient, broken, or wrong in many ways.
